To all the viewers giving exam,
These are short python program that college will probably never teach you. <br>
If you are gonna use this for copying, star this repo. <br>

Anyways,<br>
Love Yajat <br>

PS if you are a teacher reading this, Please calm down, I DID NOT USE THIS FOR MY COPYING IN MY EXAM
